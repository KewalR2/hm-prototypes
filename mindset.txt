# AI-Driven Materials Quote Flow - Mindset

## Core Philosophy
The Heavy Materials quoting system should function as an intelligent advisor that removes friction from the materials procurement process. The system should shoulder the cognitive burden, not the user.

## Key Principles
1. **Adapt to user knowledge level** - Recognize expert vs. novice users automatically
2. **Project-first approach** - Understand the whole project before suggesting specific materials
3. **Proactive intelligence** - Don't just take orders; make intelligent suggestions
4. **Contextual awareness** - Consider location, weather, regulations, and timeline
5. **Decision simplification** - Reduce complex material choices to clear options with pros/cons
6. **Continuous improvement** - Learn from past interactions to improve recommendations

## Question Strategy
- Start open-ended: "What are you working on today?"
- Adapt follow-up questions based on detail level of initial response
- Ask only what's necessary - infer information where possible
- Prioritize questions that unlock the most decision paths

## System Capabilities
1. **Project understanding** - Identify project type, scope, timeline, and requirements
2. **Material recommendation** - Suggest appropriate materials based on project needs
3. **Plant selection** - Find optimal sourcing locations based on delivery address
4. **Schedule optimization** - Coordinate delivery with project timeline
5. **Budget guidance** - Offer options at different price points with clear value propositions

## User Interaction Model
- Progressive disclosure of information - don't overwhelm
- Natural conversational flow with focused questions
- Visual confirmation of key decisions (material images, delivery maps)
- Easy path to modify any previous decision

## Response Handling
- Recognize vague vs. specific answers
- Extract structured data from natural language
- Handle incomplete information gracefully
- Confirm understanding before proceeding

## Claude Integration
Use Claude to:
1. Interpret user input and extract structured information
2. Determine most relevant next questions
3. Generate natural-sounding, contextual responses
4. Recognize user intent beyond literal statements

This approach positions Heavy Materials as a strategic partner in the construction process rather than just a materials supplier.
